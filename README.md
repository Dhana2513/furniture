This is a prototype online `Furniture Store` project to design and develop all the necessary features of client/server application using `HTML5_CSS`, `JavaScript`, `jQuery`, `PHP` and `MySQL` technologies. It provides the main functions you'd expect from an online store such as search for items, display product list, add items to the cart, register clients, login clients, and placing orders.
